# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-and-PCA-

## Motivation. 

Heart Failure is one of the most common death causes globally, taking around 17,9 millions of lifes just in 2019, according to [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)#:~:text=Cardiovascular%20diseases%20(CVDs)%20are%20the,%2D%20and%20middle%2Dincome%20countries.), consequently, it is relevant to comprehend this desease in order to create better treatments and reduce deaths due to it.   

Because of that, this project used a database from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saurabhshahane/in-hospital-mortality-prediction) to attempt to determine the most important parameters to look out for on a patient with heart desease background. 

## About repository. 

This brief repository is implemented in two ways. The first one, uses the Random Forest technique, presenting a couple of interestings threes, such as the most accurate decision three, the fastest, etc. The second implementation uses Principal Components Analysis, trying to determine the most important parameters. 
Finally, it is presented a brief comparation over both methods.
